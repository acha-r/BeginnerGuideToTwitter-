# Beginner's Guide To X (Twitter)
Twitter, a popular social media platform, underwent a significant rebranding in July 2023, emerging as X. Instead of 'tweets,' posts are the new norm on this platform. Similar to Instagram and TikTok, X offers networking, information sharing, and personal branding opportunities. Let's explore how to get started with this revamped platform.

## Setting Up Your X Account

This guide focuses on the mobile application. Start by downloading the app from the App Store for iOS or Google PlayStore for Android.

You'll be prompted to create your account by providing your name, email address, and date of birth. Note that X is for users aged thirteen (13) and above. While using your real name is not necessary, it can help others find you easily.

Customize your experience by enabling the option to tailor your feed to your interests. You'll receive a verification code via email, which you'll need to proceed. Set up your password and select a profile picture (optional).

Next, you create a unique username for your X account. It must be distinct from existing usernames.

X may request access to your contacts to suggest friends and acquaintances for you to follow. You can accept or decline this request.

Choose at least three interests to personalize your X experience. The platform may also suggest a few accounts for you to follow, including celebrities or popular figures. You need to follow at least one, but you can unfollow them later if you wish.

With these steps completed, your X account is ready!

## Navigating X's Interface

Now, let's explore the main sections of the X interface:

### Top

**For You**: Curated posts based on your interests, regardless of whether you follow the accounts that posted them.

**Following**: Posts from accounts you follow.

**The portrait-shaped icon**: This icon in the top left corner takes you to your profile, where you can view and manage your posts and interactions.

### Bottom

**Home Icon**: Your homepage, featuring posts based on your interests and the accounts you follow.

**Search Icon**: Find content and accounts on X, including trending topics. It highlights the top 5, but you can see more.

**Two Portraits-shaped Icon**: Explore and join communities on X, but it's not mandatory.

**Notification Icon**: Check your notifications.

**Message Icon**: Access your direct messages (DMs).

## Your First Post on X

To make your first post, use the blue plus sign (+) icon at the bottom right of the app. Posts have a character limit of 280, including spaces, indicated by a character counter. You can extend your post by clicking the tiny plus sign at the top right of your keyboard, creating a thread. You can also use hashtags or the @ button to tag other users.

X's flexibility in allowing you to connect with others, express your interests, and share your ideas makes it a valuable tool for personal and professional use. So, set up your X account and start sharing your thoughts with the world.
